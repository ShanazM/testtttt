    <h1>The Adventures of Sang Kancil - English in Wonderland</h1>
    <div id="page1">
        <p>Deep in the tropical rainforest of Malaysia, a clever mouse-deer named Sang Kancil woke up feeling <span class="vocab" title="Very hungry, starving.">famished</span>. He needed food and water but couldn't find anything nearby. As he searched, he came to a <span class="vocab" title="A river with muddy water.">murky</span> river. On the other side, he saw delicious red fruits under a tree.</p>
        <p>But how could he cross the river? Sang Kancil noticed some crocodiles swimming nearby. He hatched a plan!</p>
        <p>What should Sang Kancil do?</p>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="showPage('page2a')">Ask the crocodiles to help him.</a>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="showPage('page2b')">Try to swim across alone.</a>
    </div>

    <div id="page2a" class="hidden">
        <p>Sang Kancil called out to the crocodiles: “Hello, my friends! King Solomon sent me to count all the crocodiles in this river. Please line up so I can count you!”</p>
        <p>The crocodiles, afraid of King Solomon, quickly formed a line across the river. Sang Kancil jumped across their backs, counting loudly as he went.</p>
        <p>What did Sang Kancil say while counting? (Choose the correct phrase.)</p>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="showPage('correct')">“One, two, three… Thank you!”</a>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="showPage('incorrect')">“Jump, jump, jump… Almost there!”</a>
    </div>

    <div id="page2b" class="hidden">
        <p>Sang Kancil decided to swim across the river, but the water was too deep, and the current was strong. A crocodile spotted him and tried to snap at him! Sang Kancil barely escaped.</p>
        <p>Should Sang Kancil try again or think of another plan?</p>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="showPage('page2a')">Think of another plan.</a>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="showPage('end')">Give up and go back home.</a>
    </div>

    <div id="correct" class="hidden">
        <p>Congratulations! Sang Kancil successfully crossed the river and reached the fruits. He enjoyed his meal and stayed safe from the crocodiles. The crocodiles were left confused but unharmed.</p>
        <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="restartStory()">Restart the story</a>
    </div>

    <div id="incorrect" class="hidden">
        <p>Oops! The crocodiles realized they were being tricked and started chasing Sang Kancil. He had to run away quickly, still hungry and tired.</p>
        <p><strong>Try again!</strong></p>
        <a href="#" class="button" onclick="restartStory()">Restart the story</a>
    </div>

    <div id="end" class="hidden">
        <p>Sang Kancil gave up and returned home hungry. Maybe next time, he’ll come up with a better plan!</p>
        <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
